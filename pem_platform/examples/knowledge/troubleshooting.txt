Troubleshooting quick guide

1) Pressure instability
   - Check throttle valve response
   - Verify gauge calibration

2) Roughness spikes
   - Inspect RF matching network
   - Confirm gas ratio sensor stability

3) Interpreting DoE
   - For 2-level designs with coded factors (-1/+1), the regression coefficient corresponds to half the main effect.
   - Fractional factorial designs can alias (confound) effects; confirm with follow-up runs.
