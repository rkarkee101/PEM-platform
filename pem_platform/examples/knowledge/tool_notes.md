# Tool Demo Notes

## High-level behavior

- Increasing **RF power** generally increases deposition rate (thickness) but can increase ion bombardment.
- Increasing **pressure** tends to reduce mean free path; this often changes film density and can affect roughness.
- **Gas ratio** controls chemical reactivity; extremes can cause polymerization or etch-like regimes.

## Common issues

- If thickness is low and roughness is high, check: precursor delivery, chamber seasoning, and pressure control.
- Chamber B has a small systematic thickness offset vs A (example).
